1) Make a schedule if there are a surplus of scouters   
        after x matches the match scouters become the data processers, etc.

2) Start JesuScout

3) Have Scouters fill out the data and submit after each match

4) With AT LEAST ~4 games to go, export the current data

5) Drag this newly created file (matches.json, you can just search it in spotlight) onto USB Drive

6) Have a carrier take the USB drive to the pit so the data can be analyzed in Tableau or RAW json
    
7) If you don't have time to learn Tableau-->
        simply have the extra scouters (non 6 match scouters) organize the created files by team or however strategists prefer.
            give each "calculator" a different task to maximize time    
                one can organize data by team number  
                one could organize by scale/switch/climb ability
                literally any kind of grouping

***Don't let people just sit around***
        give them a task so that the data can be as useful as possible for strategists until we perfect using Tableau
